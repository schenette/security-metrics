## Defining Risk: Variance of its use in practice and language.
The language of "risk" is highly flexible. Two people talking about "risk" may be speaking at each other entirely differently.

```

risk = an unwanted event which may or may not occur.
risk = the cause of an unwanted event which may or may not occur.
risk = the probability of an unwanted event which may or may not occur.
risk = the statistical expectation value of an unwanted event which may or may not occur.
risk = the fact that a decision is made under conditions of known probabilities (“decision under risk” as opposed to “decision under uncertainty”)

```

Other definitions are used frequently. For instance, lacking a popular mitigation (Driving with no seatbelt) or something at stake, subject to other threats (a position in a stock).

### Using very specific language for scenarios
"[The clarity test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarity_test)" is described [here](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cee115/wiki/uploads/Main/Schedule/DAPracticeAndPromise.pdf).

## Scenario Modeling 

Scenario Modeling vs Probabilitic Forecasting: Will it Rain Tuesday vs There is a 20% probability it will rain Thursday

The forecast is the %, from an average, from a model, from an expert, from a panel, etc

## Probabalistic Forecasting 

### Experts Estimating Things
This section generally appeals to how experts can be queried for quantitative data. The process of doing so, industrial examples, history of.

### Parimutuel betting ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parimutuel_betting))
This describes the practice of gathering up forecast material and, typically, averaging it together. Further described in [Probabilistic Forecasts and Reproducing Scoring Systems](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_memoranda/RM6299.html)


#### References and Reading 

https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781402082016 <- De Finetti is the "father" of subjective bayesianism (which is at the heart of risk forecasting), and this book is a non-mathy introduction into the mathematics of it, but also what it "means"

https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/2009MWR2945.1 <- this is a pretty good math paper discussing why logarithmic scoring rules are better

https://www.amazon.de/dp/B005NZMSM0/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1 <- "Red-Blooded Risk" - the author has a long career in financial risk management, and ... it's a strange book; it's a bit like going for a long walk with your cranky weird uncle in the second degree that is clearly a bit strange, but has read widely and rambles for a few hours about all the things he has read and seen. So it isn't very "structured", but still enlightening and enjoyable
